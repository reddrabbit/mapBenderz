## Note:
**If you're gonna be adding photos to any page you're authoring, please use the format:**
 `_<div class="photos">`_
`_<a href="https://www.instagram.com/brentgrey/?hl=en" target="_blank"><img src="images/Ilios.jpg" alt="Che Heart Ilios War State"></a>_`
`_</div>_`

This is so that the custom CSS will be applied to your image...for responsiveness and design and also to allow the image link to something as instructed. ðŸ™‚
