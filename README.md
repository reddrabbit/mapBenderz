## Note:
**If you're gonna be adding photos to any page you're authoring, please use the format below.**

**Ensure the class for the div is specified correctly**

 `<div class="photos">`
 
`<a href="https://www.instagram.com/brentgrey/?hl=en" target="_blank"><img src="images/Ilios.jpg" alt="Che Heart Ilios War State"></a>`

`</div>`

This is so that the custom CSS will be applied to your image...for responsiveness and design and also to allow the image link to something as instructed. ðŸ™‚
