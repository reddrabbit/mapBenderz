										&lt; div class = 'mobile'&gt; 
										&lt; img src = 'path to image' alt = 'some alt text' &gt;
										&lt;/div&gt;

									And use this for desktop images ðŸ™‚: 
									<br> <pre>
										&lt; div class = 'photos'&gt;

										<h3>Weather Application </h3>

									<p>
										The first step is to select from the numerous templates on experience builder. We decided to go with the blank full screen template for our solution here. This was so we could get a feel for the interface and operability from scratch.

									<h3>Traffic Watch Dashboard</h3> 
									<p>
										The traffic watch dashboard was created using Esri's ArcGIS Dashboards service. The community service layer within the dashboard was created and 
										symbolized using ArcGIS Pro. The live traffic data layer was sourced from ArcGIS Online data portal and is owned, maintained, managed, and updated by
										ESRI.<br>The traffic layer was set to refresh every 5 minutes in order to orient the emergency services team with the most current traffic conditions
										at any given time. Icons for incident severity were also changed to appropriately convey the gravity of a road incident, ranging from Critical to Low-importance. 
									
									</p>
									
										
									<p>
										5 Dashboard elements were configured for use within the dashboard. The elements were set up with data actions to allow them change in accordance with the 
										view extent of the map. 
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>
											Pie Chart: Set up to provides a percentile overview of traffic severity within the current view of the map
										</li>
										<li>
											Bar Chart: Configured to displays a count of live traffic incidents on the map
										</li>
										<li>
											Indicator: Configured to provide a sum of community centers within the current view of the map
										</li>
										<li>
											List: Set up to present a list of community centers within the current view of the map
										</li>
										<li>
											Webmap: Hosts the map and its layers
										</li>
									</ol>

										<h3>Limitations</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The live traffic layer owned and managed by ESRI has restrictions on what fields can be used for symbolization on the web map. 
										It also shows the count of road incidents but sometimes lags and will not display these incidents on the map, thereby leading to 
										confusions when trying to pinpoint where exactly an incident is occuring at a given time. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Esri's Experience Builder widgets cannot be customized beyong the pre set functionality range. This means they cannot be made to do
										more than intended by Esri. This limitation acts as a rein during development. For example, it would have been better to have the buffer
										tool be moveable after it's been drawn on the map. However, this feature is not available in Experience Builder, and cannot customized to
										make it do so.  
									</p>
