									<h2>Mapcache</h2>
									<p>Enables you to create, view, and share GeoPackages on your Android device.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									GeoPackage MapCache has various tools and libraries which use their own implementation of GeoPackages. 
									GeoPackage MapCache is an app for android and iOS that utilizes and demonstrates the functionality in GeoPackage. 
									It downloads tiles from XYZ and WMS servers to use it in the disadvantage areas.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of its main functions is the ability to create points and collect data in the field with custom forms and photo attachments. 
									Geopackages can also be created in the desktop or mobile application and can be opened or shared to the mobile version of Mapcache application.
								</p>
								<p> Offline Functionality: All the functionality used was online and can be accessed offline without any internet connection. 
								However, it requires the map to load once prior to the loss of internet connectivity.  
								</p>

										<h3>Steps:</h3>
										<h4>Setting up - </h4>  
										<ul>	
											<li>Starting a new project by selecting ‘Create Project’</li> 	
											<li>Give appropriate name</li> 
										</ul>

									<h4>Functionality </h4>
									<p>
										In the next step we used the Mapcache functionality options.
										We decided to choose range rings (to create rings by providing lat and long), markers, rectangles and polygons functionality options.

										<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
										<h4>Benefits: </h4> 
										<p>While having an open-source platform, it is completely free and does not require any licensing. 
											The file (which was a layer) saved was in Geopackage format which does not consume much memory space. </p>

 

										<h4>Drawbacks and Limitations: </h4>
										<ul>
										<li>While the use of Geopackage is not a bad option but it is very limited and less user friendly and 
											it was difficult to import the data or file into ArcGIS Pro.</li>
											<li>It has limited data collection features which makes it difficult for the users to operate. </li>
											<li>The application and the features available in it require high maintenance. </li>

									<h2>QField</h2>
									<p>Data collection app designed to work with QGIS</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									What is Q field? Q field is an app designed for mobile data collection in the field and integrates well with 
									QGIS as it is based on QGIS with the same libraries and has basically an identical interface. The workflow by design 
									has the user create/ configure their project in QGIS first then prepare and transfer their project/data for QField using 
									a the QGIS extension QField Sync. They also have their own cloud-based service QCloud for synching data across devices.
								</p>
								<p>
									Basic features include zoom, zoom to layer, listing features in a layer, temporal filter (time), access to logs, zoom to current location 
									(based on GPS), undo button. Includes a lock feature which is useful for a still image display. It also includes a measuring tool and the ability 
									to print to pdf. 
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Offline functionality:</b> Any edits made offline will still save provided the information has been pre synched before. Must have data synched and loaded onto 
									QField app prior to loss of internet connection. Alternatively, you can have data from the cloud downloaded onto your mobile device locally then synch back when internet connectivity 
									returns. Any edits made can then be uploaded back to the cloud and accessed on QGIS.

										<h3>Workflow</h3>
									</header>
									<h4>How to use QField</h4>

									<ol>
									<li>Start new QFieldCloud Project on QGIS using existing project (or create one if needed) </li>
									<li>Synch with project data by logging into mobile QField App </li>
									<li>Make digitization and edits on mobile, save to cloud and push changes.  </li>
									<li>On QGIS synched with cloud  </li>
									<li>Edits made should appear in your QGIS project </li>

									<p>
										The workflow depicted makes use QField and QField Cloud. It is possible to use only QField but that process
										involves manually transferring the QSynch prepared project and transferring it to your mobile device such as through
										USB or sharing options but this is not as efficient as using QField Cloud features.

										<h3>Pros and Cons </h3>
									</header>
									<h4>Pros</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Is open source so does not require licensing like Esri products</li>
										<li>Has a very user-friendly UI that is intuitive and easy to navigate</li>
										<li>Seamless integration into QGIS with an extension that is easy to use</li>
										<li>QField Cloud is an easy way to sync data to your mobile device</li>
										<li>QField Cloud allows you to download a copy of the project locally to your device in case of internet issues</li>
										<li>Has a browse and edit mode</li>
										<li>QGIS has the ability to use ArcGIS REST endpoints and display it in QGIS allowing you to use in QField</li>
										<li>Free Q Field account has good amount of features
											<ul>
												<li>Unlimited public/private projects</li>
												<li>Basic data hosting and versioning</li>
												<li>File based projects only</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
									 

									<h4>Cons</h4>
									<ul>
									<li>Is open source so it is not part of Esri ArcGIS infrastructure  </li>
									<li>More QField Cloud features such as postGIS support, unlimited collaboration and better hosting
										 and versioning will require a paid subscription  </li>
									<li> Personal experience: Had issues importing data from ArcGIS REST endpoint </li>

									</ul>  

									<p>
										We encountered an issue creating a link to ArcGIS REST endpoint for data where it would say the data layer is missing despite pointing to the REST endpoint. 
										However this is more of a QGIS issue then a QField issue but is important to note as QField is designed to work with QGIS

									<h2>ArcGIS FieldMaps</h2>
									<p>Esri's solution for offline mapping</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Field Maps is Esri's main tool marketed for offline mapping. 

									First we tried loading a web map with all 8 operational layers provided by 
									the municipality of Clarington.  

									Offline areas could not handle this much data. In order to fit the entire 
									municipality in one offline area, we need to reduce the zoom extents. 
									This reduces the usability of the data significantly. 
								</p>
								<div class="photos">
									<img src="images/JmilneFieldmapsOfflineArea1.png" alt="ArcGIS FieldMaps, Creating Offline Areas">
								</div>
								<p>
									Next we tried a smaller Web Map that only contained 3 operational layers was created. 
									Field maps offline area was able to hold the entire extent of the municipality! 
								</p>
								<div class="photos">
									<img src="images/JmilneFieldmapsOfflineArea3.png" alt="ArcGIS FieldMaps, Creating Offline Areas">
								</div>
								<p>Success! But this only has 3 layers available offline, can we get more?   Yes! Checkout the next section</p>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Increased functionality using .mmpk Files!</h3>
									</header>
									
									<p>
										.mmpk files are made through ArcGIS Pro, and allow you to create maps that are searchable, and have 
										custom popups and bookmarks. Following this tutorial with Clarington's data I was able to create a 
										.mmpk file:
										<a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.1/help/sharing/overview/create-an-offline-map.htm">esri .mmpk tutorial</a>
									</p>   
										<p>Once you download the .mmpk field maps can view all 8 operational layers, access bookmarks and any set  
									</p>
									<div class="mobile">
										<img src="images/JmilneFieldmapsMMPK.png" alt="ArcGIS FieldMaps, Mobile Map Package Dispalyed on a Mobile Device">
									</div>
									<p>
										Mobile Map Packages allow you to put man operational layers offline, without limiting zoom extents. This makes them an outstanding option for areas with clear boarders, allowing emergency services to 
										make one pakage that contains their entire survice area, all in their pocket. With mmpk files you can:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Create locators that allows searching within the map</li>
										<li>Add bookmarks to frequently visited areas</li>
										<li>Customize popups</li>
									</ul>
									<p>This functionality makes .mmpk the most functional offline solution MapBenderz found. The only draw backs  with mmpks is they are only veiwable in ArcGIS FieldMaps and must be created in ArcGIS Pro (requiring licensing).
										Meaning .mmpks are limited to the functionality of FieldMaps. 
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>In conclusion</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Mobile GIS services are a great way to view and edit data in the field. Today's mobile GIS options have some great
										functionality to support offline use. These include tools such as local backups and cloud synchronization. Additional features include good UI for simplified 
										data editing or collection and good integration with their desktop counterparts.
