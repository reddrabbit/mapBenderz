									<h2>Web Based Maps - Why do they need to be online?</h2>
									<p>Explored via StoryMaps</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Web based maps by design rely on frequent server requests to provide their enhanced functionality.  

									But what Web applications require fewer server requests? Is there a web application that loads the entire map all at once, and could still function ‘offline’ until the page was refreshed? 

									To test this we discovered a handy tool in the F12 menu - you can turn a Web page offline! 

									This is part of the network throttling settings.  Designed to help programmers test their website on slower internet connections.  
								</p>
								<div class="photos">
									<img src="images/JmilneWebMaps1.png" alt="Screenshot of F12 Network Settings">
								</div>
								<p>
									But for our purposes by setting throttling to 'Offline' we are disabling server requests, by disconnecting the website from its server to understand what functions could work offline. 

									This Story map was built where we embedded web maps from may different places, and then disabled server requests, to see if they load differently and allow offline navigation

										Story maps requires server requests to pull content. To test a map,  
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Scroll to a map, and let it load fully </li>
										<li>Open the F12 menu - go to the network Ribbon </li>
										<li>Click the 'No throttling' dropdown menu</li>
										<li>Select 'Offline' to disable server requests</li>
										<li>Test the Map! What breaks and What works?</li>
									</ol>

										<h3>TL;DR Story Map results</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										None of the maps work well with server request disabled, except the Express map, but this is due to 
										the simplicity of the map, (a grey basemap with 1 labeled point and line feature) and is not 
										scalable. The most surprising results came from the Google MyMaps. Where the entire point layer 
										once loaded was navigable, and while the clustered point icon was lost, they were still 
										calculating and displaying the correct number. However the basemap was lost just like with 
										ArcGIS Online maps. This indicates that if you didn't need a basemap, it may be possible to 
										load all your operational vector layers at once, and they would be 'accessible offline' 
										(until the page refreshes).
