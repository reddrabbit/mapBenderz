									<h2>Welcome to the Experience</h2>
									<p>ESRI's one stop shop for quick and easy web development!</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									ESRI's Experience builder is a full stack solution that helps with a “quick and easy” way to deploy websites and web applications with very little to no coding knowledge required from the developer. 
								</p>

										<h3>Setting up a simple web application </h3>
									</header>
									<h4>SELECTING A TEMPLATE </h4>
									<p>
										The first step is to select from the numerous templates on experience builder. We decided to go with the blank full screen template for our solution here. This was so we could get a feel for the interface and operability from scratch. 
									</p>

									</div>
									<h4>CONNECTING TO THE DATA SOURCE(S)</h4> 
									<p>
										The next step was to connect to our data. A web map of the municipality of Clarington we created via AGOL. Experience builders allow data in the form of feature services, map services, and web scenes. Other data types (GeoJSON, CSV, etc.) cannot be added as data sources. 
									</p>

									</div>
									<h4>ADDING WIDGETS TO THE WORKSPACE</h4> 
									<p>After the data sources have been identified for the map, developers (with or without coding knowledge) can go ahead and add widgets to the map. Widgets can be used to achieve all sorts of results. From displaying map data to calculating spatial analysis. The data is consumed by widgets. </p>

										<h3>Drawbacks and Limitations:</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										We quickly discovered that the experience builder option did not support offline mapping or workflows for offline mapping in any form. We then tried to embed our offline map package we created for ESRI field maps via the Field Maps Designer, however, these offline areas cannot be viewed without the field maps mobile apps. The most you can share would be a bar code that can be scanned and a link. Both, however, only direct the end user to the ESRI Field maps’ download page, not the map itself.  

									Right now, there is no way to pair Experience Builder and all its functionality with Field Maps’ offline functionality. 

									As stated in the overview, the widgets do not have any proper dialogue for how they work and how they can be configured to reach their full potential. Requires a bit of repetitive trials and configuration to get it done.  
									</p>
									<header>
										<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Getting a web application deployed using ESRI’s Experience Builder is as quick as they say but may be a bit challenging for first time users.  

										The challenging part lies in trying to link a widget’s functions with another widget. Outside of this, it is a useful tool to deploy web apps and offers analytical widgets to fulfill spatial needs.
